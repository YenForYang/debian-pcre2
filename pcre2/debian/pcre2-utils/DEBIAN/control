Description: New Perl Compatible Regular Expression Library - utilities
 This is PCRE2, the new implementation of PCRE, a library of functions
 to support regular expressions whose syntax and semantics are as
 close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language. New projects
 should use this library in preference to the older library,
 confusingly called pcre3 in Debian.
 .
 This package contains the utilities pcre2grep (like grep with PCRE)
 and pcre2test (a test program for the library, but also useful for
 experimenting with regular expressions). Both programs are also
 useful examples of programming with libpcre2.
